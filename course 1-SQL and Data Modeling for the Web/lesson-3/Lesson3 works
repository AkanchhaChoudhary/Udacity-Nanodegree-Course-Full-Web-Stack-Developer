WHAT I DID IN THIS LESSON:

1.created basic flask application(Hello.py)
2.INcorporated and confirgured SQLAlchemy to application to communicate with real database
3.Inserting records in application by creating instance of the database "db = SQLAlchemy(app)"
4.using db.create_all() to create table for models

MY LEARNING FROM THIS LESSON:
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
db is an interface for interacting with our database
db.Model lets us create and manipulate data models
db.session lets us create and manipulate database transactions
FLASK_APP=hello.py flask run
